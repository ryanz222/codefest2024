Here are some of the best Greek islands for different types of travelers! #ExpediaAmbassador 🇬🇷 
•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
With over 6,000 islands and islets scattered across the Aegean and Ionian Seas, each island offers something special.

🇬🇷 Mykonos: This island is known for day clubs and nightlife—though it’s not ALL there is to do, so I always recommend it for a girls trip! Rent and ATV to explore the island and all of the amazing beaches, stroll the Old Town, and have tons of fun!

🇬🇷 Santorini: While there are beautiful beaches here, this island is known for the luxury cave hotels in Oia and Fira. It’s the perfect romantic destination for lazy afternoons at the pool and incredible sunset dinners.

🇬🇷 Naxos: If you’re wanting to avoid the crowds and “tourist” prices, Naxos might be perfect for you. This is a great island for families and kitesurfing enthusiasts. Be sure to rent a car through @Expedia and get your international driver’s license well in advance, as you’ll need one to get around!

🇬🇷 Milos: This island truly has it all, and is a great destination for all types of travelers! There are incredible restaurants and amazing beaches. Rent a boat to explore the small neighboring islands, go cliff jumping at Sarakiniko beach, and visit the old fishing villages.

As you plan your Greek holiday, use @expedia to find the best flight prices and book your entire trip in one spot!

PS: Expedia Group brought the family closer with a unified and expanded loyalty program called One Key, and it’s not just for @expedia. @hotelsdotcom and the vacation rental site, @vrbo, are all part of the fun!
